  <h3>EVM/VVPAT</h3>
  <p>The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM), the replacement of the ballot box is mainstay in the electoral process. First conceived in 1977 in the Election Commission, the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. (ECIL), Hyderabad was assigned the task to design and develop it. In 1979 a proto-type was developed, which was demonstrated by the Election Commission before the representatives of political parties on 6th August, 1980. The Bharat Electronic Ltd. (BEL), Bangalore, another public-sector undertaking, was co-opted along with ECIL to manufacture EVMs once a broad consensus was reached on its introduction.</p> <a href="/voter/history-of-evm/">
  The Election Commission of India has been using EVMs in all elections to the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha since 2001. More than 315 crores votes have been recorded in EVMs to date..</p>
