Especially, the various technological tools have enabled the Commission to bring in more efficiency, widespread reach, and accountability in the conduct of free and fair elections in recent times.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The ecosystem of new apps in <abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> especially mobile apps have played a major role in elections. The mobile apps provides better personalization, ease of sending notifications, mobile-specific features such as camera to capture, contact list access, Geographic Navigation System, phone calls, accelerometer, compass and the ability to work offline thereby making it more user friendly for voters and Election Officials.&nbsp;<br>
	Election Commission of India has used this opportunity and developed a suite of 20 Apps that provides a perfect ecosystem for rolling the giant wheel of the electoral system from Registration to Results. The elections have following 4 technological phases where the ecosystem of these applications are used. These four phases are described briefly as below:</span>
</p>

<ol><li>
		<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Non-Election:</strong> This phase depicts the continuous phase when the voters register into the system and there are no major elections scheduled.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Pre-election:</strong> This phase starts generally one year / 6 months before the elections and extends up to the date of the announcement of elections. This phase is characterized by Election Planning and preparation.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>In-elections:</strong> This phase is the most important phase which starts from the date of the announcement, runs through the poll day, and ends on the conclusion of counting.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Post-elections:</strong> This phase signifies the time when the reports are generated and post audits are done after the end of the elections.</span>
	</li>
</ol><p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The apps work in tandem during non-election, pre-election, in-election and post-election phases to create a perfect ecosystem providing seamless interfaces for all stakeholders. The applications have been so designed carefully, that they cover all the phases effectively.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:22px;">Phase 1: Non-Election Phase</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><a class="ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_left" href="https://voterportal.eci.gov.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" style="float: left;" target="_blank"><img alt="Voter Portal" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_left" data-fileid="1023" data-ratio="161.67" data-unique="a5ipl2jms" style="width: 300px; height: auto; float: left;" width="520" data-src="https://eci.gov.in/uploads/monthly_2020_09/voter-portal1.jpg.90a6396f5c8c46b999ac946c9d5d2203.jpg" src="https://eci.gov.in/uploads/monthly_2020_09/voter-portal1.jpg.90a6396f5c8c46b999ac946c9d5d2203.jpg" data-loaded="true"></a>The first application for the non- election phase, where there is no obvious activity undertaken for the preparation of an election but is primarily characterised by voter enrolment, improvement of polling station facilities and strengthening of the electoral roll. The Election Commission of India utilizes ICT application for new voter registration, correction of entries, and migration cases apart from polling station rationalisation.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">There are four methods by which a new voter is engaged.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">First method is through the use of the <em><strong><a href="https://voterportal.eci.gov.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Voter Portal.</a></strong></em> The portal provides the facility of searching names in the electoral roll by using the EPIC number or personal details, registration of new voters, corrections of particulars, and migration cases inside or outside the assembly constituency. The voter can submit the form and upload the relevant documents with ease using this app. There is no requirement to submit hard copies of the documents. Once the forms are submitted, the citizen can visit the portal and check the status of the submitted application.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The feature of integration with Digilocker facilitates uploading of the documents with ease.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><a href="https://eci.gov.in/uploads/monthly_2020_09/vha.jpg.34f5f7b6aa9c9fd0ee2b7255181a1d5c.jpg" title="Enlarge image" data-wrappedlink="" data-ipslightbox="" data-ipslightbox-group="undefined"><img alt="vha.jpg" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right" data-fileid="1027" data-ratio="170.41" data-unique="gdz97g05n" style="width: 169px; height: auto; float: right;" width="169" data-src="https://eci.gov.in/uploads/monthly_2020_09/vha.jpg.34f5f7b6aa9c9fd0ee2b7255181a1d5c.jpg" src="https://eci.gov.in/uploads/monthly_2020_09/vha.jpg.34f5f7b6aa9c9fd0ee2b7255181a1d5c.jpg" data-loaded="true"></a>The second method is through the use of the award-winning <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/mobile-applications/voter-helpline-app-r27/" rel="">Voter Helpline Mobile App</a></strong></em>. This mobile application connects five databases for <abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> together &nbsp;thereby presenting seamless services for the citizens. &nbsp;The mobile application allows Indian Voters to search &nbsp;their names from 920 million electors in a fraction of a second. &nbsp;The voter can verify their name, the polling station, details in the voter card, and also the election schedule. &nbsp;If a voter already has &nbsp;a voter ID card then the App provides facility to verify the details by simply scanning the barcode of voter id card.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The mobile app provides submission of forms for voter registration, migration and corrections. The user can simply upload the documents and fill the form. The form goes directly to the Electoral Registration Officer of the relevant Assembly Constituency for decision.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">If the Voter is unable to avail the services, he can directly file a complaint to <abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> using the mobile app. The Voter Helpline App is available both on iOS and on Android. The App has been downloaded 25 Million times and 54 Million electoral searches have been performed till date.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The third method is by <strong>SMS</strong>. By sending a short message at a designated number, a voter can verify the presence of their names in electoral register.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The fourth method is by <strong>calling toll free 1950:</strong> 1950 is one universal number available across India by which any user can call from any mobile operator and can talk to election-related issues in more than 22 languages. &nbsp;The agents are trained to operate on a universal portal for searching the names of the voters, taking the requests of new forms, and also lodging a complaint in case of any grievance. &nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The unique feature of the call centre is that it is available in all Districts and State Headquarters, but they are all connected by a common backbone of ICT application called as National Grievance Services Portal. </span>
</p>

Special efforts were made to ensure ICT enablement for Persons with Disabilities. This second application called <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/mobile-applications/the-person-with-disabilities-app-r25/" rel="">PWD App</a></strong></em> was launched with the primary focus to ensure wider participation of Persons With Disabilities (PWD).&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">This application is specifically designed to keep visual impairment, hearing impairment, and other disabilities into mind. PWD users can search their names &amp; their voter ID details using this app. &nbsp;The Commission has provided detailed facilities for requesting doorstep facility for form filling to PwD electors. &nbsp;The application also provided the facility for marking themselves as PwD by describing their locomotive disability and requesting for wheelchairs. The visually impaired persons can hear the list of contesting candidates exactly as per the ballot sequence in the form 7A. Thus, they can confidently go to the polling station and press the right button in the Electronic Voting Machine. The application is available both on Android and iOS platforms.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The third application called <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/rti-online-portal-r17/" rel=""><abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> RTI Portal </a></strong></em>provides an online platform for requesting for right to information. Not just the application provides filing of RTI application but it provides filing of appeal and payment of RTI fees. This application provides the perfect means for improving the transparency and visibility.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The fourth application, very active during the Non-Election period, is called the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation program. It provides for voter education, spreading voter awareness and promoting voter literacy in India. The <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/sveep-website-r19/" rel="">SVEEP Portal</a></strong></em> provides an effective digital engagement platform. The website contains &nbsp;forums, quizzes, manuals, tutorials and also provides a facility for voters to share photographs during the polling day.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The fifth application is about the <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/eci-website-r21/" rel=""><abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> website</a></strong></em> that has been created by the <abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> to provide deep integration of mobile applications and provide various accessibility and mobile-friendly features. The website has a modern interface, easy access and search and content driven framework. The new website contains information from the 1952 election onwards and is updated dynamically.</span>
</p>

<p>

Once the political party submits its application, a unique number is allocated, and thereafter by using this number he/she can track the status of his application online on his/her mobile. All types of discrepancies are intimated to the application from the portal itself and the intimation of registration is communicated online. This has brought in time-bound disposal and openness in Political party registration.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:22px;">Phase 2: Pre-election &nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size:18px;">Planning Phase</span><br><span style="font-size:16px;">Six months to one year before the election depending upon the nature of election, a large scale planning exercise is undertaken with a view to move the Electronic Voting Machines and prepare for the material and resources. The machines’ requirement is assessed and then the machines are moved from manufacturer to district warehouses and also from one district warehouse to the other district warehouse of the States based upon the requirements.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">To track and record the end to end movement for each machine from placement to destruction, a seventh application was developed as a new centralized software and is called <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/evm-management-system-ems-r29/" rel=""><abbr title="Electronic Voting Machine"><abbr title="Electronic Voting Machine">EVM</abbr></abbr> Management System (EMS)</a></strong></em>. The EMS is designed to manage inventory of <abbr title="Electronic Voting Machine"><abbr title="Electronic Voting Machine">EVM</abbr></abbr> units i.e. tracking of units from manufacturer to state, &nbsp;state to &nbsp;state, and &nbsp;district to &nbsp;district. The Election commission strictly ensures a highly secure, non-interrupted, and non-manipulated distribution of machines from one place to another place managed by district warehouses using this web application.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The whole process of the Randomization of Ballot Unit, Control Unit, and <abbr title="Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail"><abbr title="Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail">VVPAT</abbr></abbr> is &nbsp;done multiple times in the presence of Political Parties and then finalized using the EMS softwares. This has added another layer of a confidence-building measure to establish the neutrality of the <abbr title="Electronic Voting Machine"><abbr title="Electronic Voting Machine">EVM</abbr></abbr> machines.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">Apart from Machine movement, various electoral exercises like improvement of health of electoral roll, new voter registration and updating of records are done using an online application called as <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/ero-net-r13/" rel="">ERONET</a></strong></em>.</span>

It is a mobile application designed by the Election Commission of India, with an opportunity to report election code violations directly by citizens. It is widely available, easy to use, &nbsp;generates legally tenable and prosecutable information to administrators. Chief Electoral Officers, District Election Officers, Returning Officers, flying squads and Police who all use the ICT application in prompt disposal of Model Code, &nbsp;Expenditure violation cases.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">A trinity of factors working simultaneously makes <abbr title="Citizen Vigilance"><abbr title="Citizen Vigilance">cVIGIL</abbr></abbr> a successful. Users capture audios, photos or videos in real-time, and a <em>“100-minute” countdown for time-bound disposal of complaints is ensured</em>. The app automatically enables a geo-tagging feature as soon as the user switches on their camera in the <abbr title="Citizen Vigilance"><abbr title="Citizen Vigilance">cVIGIL</abbr></abbr> to report a violation. This means that flying squads could know the precise location of a reported violation, and the image captured by citizens could be used as evidence in the court of law.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The result: nearly <em>1,42,250 complaints were received in the 2019 parliamentary election period; 99% of which were disposed of and 80% of which were found correct</em>. Previously only 20-25% of complaints received were found to be correct for the cases reported under model code of conduct.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The ninth application is an extended portal of <abbr title="Citizen Vigilance"><abbr title="Citizen Vigilance">cVIGIL</abbr></abbr> called <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/mcc-relaxation-violation-portal-r31/" rel="">MCC violation portal </a></strong></em>to make MCC violations data available in the public domain. &nbsp;It allows the publication of all important MCC violation cases, notice issued, and decision of <abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> through this online portal.

The candidates are provided with an option to file their candidature online, digitise their affidavit and deposit the security through online payment. The system generates the printable filled-in form consisting of the QR code for easy submission to the returning officer. This is a significant milestone in the candidate nomination process especially relevant during the COVID pandemic. Once the application is filed successfully, the candidate can track their scrutiny status from the portal or by using the exclusive candidate app o the <abbr title="Election Commission of India"><abbr title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr></abbr> called as <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/mobile-applications/candidate-app-election-permission-r55/" rel="">Candidate suvidha app</a></strong></em>.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The Election Commission of India has designed in-house software for complete Candidate and election management through a software called <strong>ENCORE</strong> which stands for <em>Enabling Communications on Real-time Environment</em>. This provide seamless facility for Returning Officer to process candidate nomination, affidavit, Voter turnout, counting, results and data management.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">The eleventh application is called <em><strong><a href="https://eci.gov.in/it-applications/web-applications/candidate-scrutiny-application-r59/" rel="">ENCORE Scrutiny Application</a></strong></em>. It is a part of ENCORE that allows Returning Officers to do scrutiny of the nominations filed by the candidates. Each nomination is verified and the status is marked as ‘Accepted’, ‘Rejected’ or ‘Withdrawn’ depending on the candidate’s nomination acceptance, rejection or withdrawal of candidature. This helps the Returning Officer to prepare the final list of contesting candidates and assign the symbols.</span>
